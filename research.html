			<p style="font-size: 1.14em; line-height: 1.7em;"></br>The UCL Research Team is leading new developments into this field.</br> Particularly of note, Peter O'Hearn of the UCL PPLV research team developed Separation Logic which as has facilitated the development of programs to verify programs written in imperative programming languages. Members of the UCL PPLV research team were also directly involved in developing Facebook's INFER program, implementing separation logic which is used to ensure that phone applications can be developed quickly. </br></p>

			<h3><b>Impacts</b></h3>

			<p style="font-size: 1.3em; line-height: 1.7em;">
			As PPLV is centered around improving the logical concepts behind Computer Science, research done by PPLV has impacts over a huge breadth of fields. We've chosen to include a couple impacts that we found the most interesting below. Hopefully this should help you to get an idea of what the PPLV department does.</p>
</div>

            <h4 style="font-size: 1.3em; line-height: 1.7em;"><strong> Gaming Market ( Boosted automatic verification Research Project )</strong><sup>[<a href="meta.html#h4-research">3</a>]</sup></h4>
<p align="" style="font-size: 1.14em; line-height: 1.7em;">
<br>The core code (known as kernel code) for the Graphical Processing Unit (GPU)<sup>[<a href="meta.html#h4-research">4</a>]</sup>, is responsible for ensuring a high frame rate, smooth gameplay and a good visual appearance. This code is now being developed by automatic verification algorithms developed by researchers in PPLV.<br></br>
The kernel code is the low level code required for the GPU to function - previously it was developed and tested by humans, however, thanks to PPLV, it is now being developed using automatic verification algorithms. These algorithms find a way to maximise memory usage and identify bugs faster than any human could.</br></br>
These increases in efficiency may be one of the main factors in the UK gaming industry's recent economic growth - there is currently a high demand for GPUs.

<h4 style="font-size: 1.3em; line-height: 1.7em;"><strong>  Phone industry ( Program Verification Research Project )</strong> <sup>[<a href="meta.html#h4-research">5</a>]</sup></h4>
<p align="" style="font-size: 1.14em; line-height: 1.7em;">
<br>Researchers at UCL also helped to develop Separation Logic and Bunched Logic, which are revolutionary new Logical models which allow imperative programs (written in languages such as C, Python, etc.) to be automatically verified.</br></br> The results of these discoveries are used by FaceBook in their <a>INFER project</a>, which is used to check phone applications for memory leaks and other problems. This facilitates the quick development of code for mobile devices. Currently there are over 250,000,000 android phones alone in use, all running similarly checked software, so it's easy to see how this development has actually shaped the modern world as we know it.

<h4 style="font-size: 1.3em; line-height: 1.7em;"><strong>  Business Sector ( Algebra and Logic for Policy and Utility in Information Security Project )</strong> <sup>[<a href="meta.html#h4-research">6</a>]</sup></h4>
 <p align="" style="font-size: 1.14em; line-height: 1.7em;">
By producing a universal way of representing security issues within a system, managers within the industry can more easily model their policies to be sustainable, effective and affordable.</br></br> For example  environmental policies such as recycling machines and paper and conforming to specific laws within a country. By using algebra and logic as a foundation to create models this addresses security flaws within organisations in relation to national laws, regulations and agreements.

			<h3>Resource Management</h3>

			<p>

			Developing automated methods of replicating the process done by programmers as they analyse the way their program handles resources or extending current computational logical models (separation logic, bunched logic) to other fields - such as using it to manage food or financial resources.

			<h3>Concurrent Program verification</h3>
			<p>
			Developing new automated methods of checking whether code is semantically correct (does what it's meant to) using Separation Logic. Current methods rely on hard coded identifiers for data structures which means that the verification will fail if an unknown data structure is found.</p>

			<h3>PPLV</h3>
			<p>As you can see, PPLV is an area under constant research - any and every development in this field has significant impacts on the field of Computer Science.</p>

            <h3> The Future...</h3>
            <p> Some possible future developments that UCL might look into are self-driving cars. This will require car verification techniques to produce accurate models and alogorithms to prevent vechiles from crashing as well as allowing them to accelerate, deacclerate, turn and stop. Other companies such as Google have already started creating driveless cars.</p>
